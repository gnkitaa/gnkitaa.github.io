# About

<img align=left src="./images/me_crop.jpg" width="250"/>

I am an Applied Scientist in India Machine Learning team at [Amazon, Bangalore](https://www.amazon.science/). I am broadly interested in learning from limited data, natural language processing, explainability in AI and reinforcement learning. Recently, I have been working on problems such as contextual bandits for recommendation systems, inducing product taxonomy from user behaviour on e-commerce platforms and meta-learning approaches for curation of event specific products.

Previosuly, I also worked in Advanced Technology Lab at [Samsung Research, Bangalore](https://research.samsung.com/sri-b). There, I worked on computational methods for detecting and analyzing misinformation on the web. Checkout my work in this area [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7nq1kBMAAAAJ&hl=en)!

I did my Master's from Indian Institute of Science, where I was very fortunate to work with Professor [P.S. Sastry](http://www.ee.iisc.ac.in/faculty/sastry/) and Professor [Gurunath Gurrala](http://www.ee.iisc.ac.in/faculty/gurunath/) on Instability Prediction in Power Systems using Deep Learning methods.
