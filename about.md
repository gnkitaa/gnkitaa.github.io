# About

I am an Applied Scientist in India Machine Learning team at Amazon Bangalore. I am broadly interested in natural language processing, explainability in AI and reinforcement learning. I have worked on problems such as contextual bandits for recommendation systems, inducing product taxonomy using policy gradient and meta learning approcahes for product curation.

Previosuly, I also worked in Advanced Technology Lab at Samsung Research, Bangalore. I worked on computational methods for detecting and analyzing misinformation on the web. I did my Master's from Indian Institute of Science where I was very fortunate to work with Professor P.S Sastry and Gurunath Gurrala on Instability Prediction in Power Systems using Deep Learning and Machine Learning approaches.
