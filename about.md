# About

I am an Applied Scientist in India Machine Learning team at [Amazon, Bangalore](https://www.amazon.science/). I am broadly interested in natural language processing, explainability in AI and reinforcement learning. I have worked on problems such as contextual bandits for recommendation systems, inducing product taxonomy from user behaviour on e-commerce platforms and meta-learning approaches for curation of event specific products.

Previosuly, I also worked in Advanced Technology Lab at [Samsung Research, Bangalore](https://research.samsung.com/sri-b). There, I worked on computational methods for detecting and analyzing misinformation on the web. I did my Master's from Indian Institute of Science, where I was very fortunate to work with Professors [P.S Sastry](http://www.ee.iisc.ac.in/faculty/sastry/) and [Gurunath Gurrala](http://www.ee.iisc.ac.in/faculty/gurunath/) on Instability Prediction in Power Systems using Deep Learning methods.
