# About 

<img src="./images/me_crop.jpg" width="200"/>

<p align="justify"> I am an Applied Scientist in India Machine Learning team at <a href="https://www.amazon.science/">Amazon, Bangalore</a>. I am broadly interested in learning from limited data, natural language processing, explainability in AI and reinforcement learning. Recently, I have been working on problems such as contextual bandits for recommendation systems, inducing product taxonomy from user behaviour on e-commerce platforms and meta-learning approaches for curation of event specific products.</p>

<p align="justify"> Previosuly, I also worked in Advanced Technology Lab at <a href="https://research.samsung.com/sri-b">Samsung Research, Bangalore</a>. There, I worked on computational methods for detecting and analyzing misinformation on the web. Checkout my work in this area <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7nq1kBMAAAAJ&hl=en">here!</a></p>

<p align="justify"> I did my Master's from Indian Institute of Science, where I was very fortunate to work with Professor <a href="http://www.ee.iisc.ac.in/faculty/sastry/">P.S. Sastry</a> and Professor <a href="http://www.ee.iisc.ac.in/faculty/gurunath/">Gurunath Gurrala</a> on Instability Prediction in Power Systems using Deep Learning methods.</p>
